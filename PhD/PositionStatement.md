Practice & Position Statement

I bring people together from across disciplines, practices and backgrounds around unique, playful and collaborative projects and spaces. These projects manifest as table-top workshops, demos, maker fairs, artist labs, media labs, market stalls, micro conferences, performances, open source hardware & software, production lines, temporary  installations, card games, artefacts, hackdays, symposia, minecraft maps, publications, cafés, residencies, text adventures, game hacks and jams, ‘Critical Kits’ and learning resources.

The projects often explore potential transformative points in science and technology through a contextual, participatory and situated practice that fosters forms of communal ‘grass roots’ literacy, agency and ultimately, resilience. I take selected practices from technical culture and embed them in situations to build new and engaging perspectives. I see the sciences and the technical not as subjects for artistic spectacle, speculation or critique but rather cultures for artists to critically participate in.

This non-representational approach entangles ‘master’ narratives of emerging or established research with other knowledge practices through critical doing, playing and making. These become strategic social encounters intuitively distilled from the careful building of unique relationships, collaborations and conversations from key individuals and communities,.

I use the term technical culture to refer to a broad social space of science and  engineering practices that extend and give critical perspective to ‘maker’ culture which has been a recent setting for this practice. It encompasses the idea of ‘digital making’ but also the lived experience of maintaining software, systems, communities and hardware often through hybrid forms of documentation. It is informed by the sciences and manifests across amateur, artisan and professionalised crafts and systems engineering. It relates to a ‘Deep Time Of the Media’ an archeology that includes the detailed study of broader historical medialab culture and more recent mappings of Makerspaces by NESTA and RCA et al. Technical culture is seen as an entangled social sphere of the communities that build and maintain the physical systems, services and artefacts of science in the human environment. 
Foreground

I have recently used the concept of “Critical-Kits” as a tool to engage in this culture and open up a space for the ‘messy’ humanities. Critical Kits is a collaborative project I co-developed with Re-Dock looking at post-’maker’ culture and how it meets participatory, inclusive and community-based forms of artistic practice. Many of the concerns of this project have led to the approach for this proposal

‘Maker’ or ‘DIY’ practices, again seen from the perspective of the upstream source of technical culture, often partly formalised in innovation spaces, are increasingly embedded in both the home and the laboratory; these are spaces where a ‘scientific literacy’ plays out: this literacy is made up of diverse knowledge practices but result in a slippery mix of agency and control, ethics and anxiety. 

I’ve been exploring this area with Domestic Science and Re-Dock and through work using Minecraft as an encounter with the Internet Of Things, RF-Craft part of the FACT CloudMaker project and data culture through Interactive Non-Fiction while being embedded in the technical culture of the co-working and makerspace DoESLiverpool.  
Study
Critical Kits Bio-club: Exploring the ‘dark matter’ of scientific literacy in the Biomedical & Life Sciences through resilience in laboratory and domestic spaces.
Dark matter is invisible yet inferred, entangled with everything, distributed everywhere but difficult to quantify; the gravity well of dark matter accounts for our own galaxy holding together and not flying away and yet it remains elusive and opaque in it’s nature. As a metaphor for describing the opportunities, problems and key processes of collaborating across artistic and scientific practices, co-creation, literacy and knowledge as a practice it’s a useful, slippery thing.

This practice based study will use methods and concerns from my practice to explore the transformative research area of bacterial communication, behaviour and taxis that is being used across the fields of digital culture in network design, security, communication and autonomous based technology. 

Study the outcomes of embedding this practice in a group of biomedical researchers in Microbial communication & taxis, Microfluidics and Transmission of disease by insect vectors. This informal group, ClubBioMed led with Dr Rod Dillon at the faculty of Biomedical Life Sciences at Lancaster University will become a focal point for the practice based research. A series of critical reflections alongside a practice based methodology will lead to a series of encounters situated in laboratory practice and in the wider public sphere; ‘Critical Kits’ that will provoke models of scientific literacy, agency and resilience within biological research, pedagogy and artistic practice.

These artistic encounters co-created with scientists in the Biomedical and Life sciences and supported by a network of cross discipline peers will act as an embodied case study with  ‘critical kits’ distributed in a range of social spaces and contexts from laboratory to local library, charity shop to indoor market, conference to country show, living room to allotment, makerspace to National trust property.
