## Quotes from various reading lists

"The linear narratives of many technological emergences, just as those for scientific discovery, often discount the accidents, blocked pathways and fortuitous combinations that often result in teleological triumphalism. The Office urges those complications to the heroic narrative to be accounted for and considered. Because, as we have to acknowledge, only what can be typed, tabulated and filed exists: before any narrative, there is a technology and a clerk performing the work
of inscription."

"So I think my problem, and "our" problem, is how to have *simultaneously* an account of radical historical contingency for all knowledge claims and knowing subjects, a critical practice for recognizing our own "semiotic technologies" for making meanings *and* a no-nonsense commitmaent to fatihful accounts of a "real" world, one that can be partically shared and that is friendly to earthwide projects of finite freedom, adequate material abundance, modest meaning in suffering, and limited happiness.

Harding calls this necessary multiple desire a need for a successor science project and a postmodern insistence on irreducible difference and radical multiplicity of local knowledges. *All* components of the desire are paradoxical and dangerous, and their combination is both contradictory an necessary. Feminists don't need a doctrine of objectivity that promises transcendence, a story that losees track of its mediations just where someone might be held responsible for something and unlimited instrumental power." 

"We don't want a theory of innocent powers to represent the world, where language and bodies both fall into the bliss of organic symbiosis. We also don't want to theorize the world, much less act within it, in terms of Global Systems, but we do need an earth-wide network of connections, including the ability partially to translate knowledges among very difficult - and power-differentiated - communities.

We need the power of modern critical theories of how meanings and bodies get made not in order to deny meanings and bodies, but in order to build meanings and bodies that have a chance for life."

**Donna Haraway**, *Situated Knowledges*.


"...we were talking about the notion of scientific literacy and how scientific literacy has grown up to be the sole responibility of the Sciences. But what is scientific literacy?...a different kind of literacy is actually required for doing science...consideration of the ethical, social and legal implications of various new sciences and technologies after the fact is not robust enough.

For example, we considered the new field of bioethics in which ethics is taken to be solely a matter of considering the imagined consequences of scientific projects that alreday given. But the notion of consequences is based on the wrong temmporality: asking after potential consequnces is too little, too late, becasuse ethics of course, is being done right at the lab bench.
And so, as for what it takes to be scientifically literate, the question is what does it take in order to identify the various apparatuses of bodily production that are at stake here. And so in order to identify those we need a much broader sense of literacy and we need all kinds of people around the lab bench, so that scientific literacy should no longer be seen as being solely the resposibility of the sciences."

"In the Roman Empire, the curator was the civil servant and public administrator of public utilities such as transport, hygiene, policing, sewer and drainage systems, aqueducts, navigation, roads, games, even accounting. They had the responsibility of “repairing” things in a culture that values reuse and recycling over tabula rasa. In the Middle Ages, their mundane activities acquire a spiritual meaning, at a time when "solicitude" can be applied to both the souls of the people and their worldly affairs. Without a doubt, these practices have provided the framework for the duties of the modern-day curator.

The vicissitudes of conservation, circulation, trade, dismemberment, dispersal, tinkering, restoration, collecting and exhibiting are not specific to the care for the "well-being" of works of art. They are intrinsically part of their stories, composing a history in transition that is sometimes broken by ruptures and shaped by destruction."

**Paul Dourish**, *Where The Action Is*



 Yes the scientific facts are indeed constructued but they cannot be reduced to the social dimension because this dimension is populated by objects mobilized to construct it. Yes, those objects are real but they look so much  like social actors that they cannot be reduced to the reality 'out there' invented by the philosophers of science. The agent of this double construction - science with society, society with science - emerges out of a set of practices that the notion of
 deconstruction grasps as badly as possible. The ozone hole is too social and too narrated to be truly natural;
