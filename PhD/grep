Yes coffee in my place might be easier. Next Friday at home, possibly Tuesday as well. 
I am in work today got a 5-6 Friday lecture!

They are used to me doing slightly odd things here. I am supportive of the idea and I guess if we can show that there is a 'benefit' to Lancaster in this then it would help :)


I am not bothered by the ownership thing by the way. 


Thanks

Subject: Re: phd and crypto kitties

Just a thought but wanted to say that my phd wouldn't 'take over' the ClubBioMed idea by the way but use that project as a key case study and a way of exploring methodologies.

Just didnt want to 'take over/ownership' of the work you and me been doing and all your prior stuff. 

Had really good chat with Mark Wright at LJMU yesterday (who's linked to FACT lab which is handy) and he offered to be my art supervisor

Do you think it's a potential issue working across LJMU & LU? Does it depend how we frame the relationship? Key is that LJMU providing a fully funded phd scholarship I guess; so stipend, fees and and then some running costs which we could use and top up with ace money https://www.ljmu.ac.uk/research/phd-scholarships

Could you be critical advisor or a PhD supervisor? Recall you already have commitments there internally

If you can have a think how it might work let me know, but realise you probably not in for a while. We should have a coffee at some point, I can always come over to your place

PS Wondered about doing a microbial take on this weird blockchain project thats gone so 'viral' (sorry) it's slowing down the ethereum cryptocurrency (its like an alt bitcoin) https://www.cryptokitties.co

Giving micro-organisms a market asset value on a blockchain and seeing how they behave sounds something Maria Angela will like that!
theres even a tutorial how to make one https://medium.com/loom-network/how-to-code-your-own-cryptokitties-style-game-on-ethereum-7c8ac86a4eb3

i think a PhD would be great route for you and you would be an ideal candidate. It can open many doors and be a good focus for you in terms of your well being.  The freelance things is very limiting. 
Yes grass i greener, in my case i might try some consultancy regarding overseas work combined with some bioart projects that dont pay me more than travel costs etc.

great just an idea. Project to project way of working just becoming a 
tough hill to climb these days, phd (with whoever it needs to be ) 
just could help and set me on a more healthy path (both for the 
research work and my sanity)

Yes was worried about LJMU/LU implications. Let me know if you get to chat to anyone would appreciate it. We'd have to be clear on the relationship between organisations and in fact that should be part of the phd research how you work across disciplines and research institutions...

Dunno whether this route is just grass is greener. Sounds like we 
doing a tag team swap academia / freelance! Just long term thinking I 
could get teaching jobs down the line to support my work and not have 
to generate everything myself

Yes we could just try knock something together; she might be good to 
edit and reflect on what we come up with down the line

Hey remote lecturing! Sounds good; you need to get a snazzy pro gamer 
setup with headset and swivel seat and a chat stream

Just let me know if you time for coffee before xmas

Woah 3 months rest!  Im off to hydrotherapy/physio tomorrow, its not much fun but feel better after Better get that video setup!

Keep in touch and stay well
R

first impression of idea is yes sounds great. Would have to think about implications LJMU vs LU and ask our faculty but i am all for open collaboration!

To be honest I am thinking about my future options re leaving and going 'freelance' doing things i actually want to do....but not in next couple of years.
I talked to MAF she's very busy, i think i would just go ahead with it but i am stuffed with admin and teaching at the moment. Discovered i can record lectures at home and upload them which is useful!

Saw physio  yesterday and 3 months recuperation suggested. Anyway I am fine thanks.

hey do you want to try catch up before xmas? Hows the leg?

Im now thinking about re-framing the ClubBioMed idea as a practice based phd across Lancaster and LJMU; that way it can pay for my time working on it for 3 years full time and lead to proper long term research in this area together. Can easily place me doing logistics and fundraising for stuff we do as part of the practice. Reflecting, just going for project based Arts council funds is just not going to be enough support; its enough to support production but not research; research feels like its just been de-prioritised in the Arts Council.

Theres an opportunity of a fully funded phd studentship at LJMU 
closing in Feb 2018 and I really want to frame it around clubbiomed 
and have you and the Faculty as the major partner; then it would be 
substantial research that would benefit you and your faculty (& LJMU) 
& it would mean the idea does not have to be so focussed into a pure 
public engagement framework (but that will be part of it) but would 
be about developing stuff in and around the lab & department and 
bringing in other artists not just Hwa Young and me.  It could be 
much closer to the articulation of wider benefits of embedding 
artists in microbiological research to do cross discipline stuff. 
Would still focus on alternative game formats (the arcade etc) but as 
spaces to think about biological research and science communication

What do you think? Could this work? Talked to a friend of mine at LJMU and they think it could work or at least they love the idea although ive not given them details of your research or anything just idea of exploring microbial communication through game and digital making culture.

Also still really want to do the corporate workshop idea, did you get to meet with Maria Angela?

We could easily put on stuff through FACT via this and then try build connections with Nathan and Jen to involve LICA and still use local libraries and places in cumbria through Glenn's connections in Barrow and cumbria.

It could fund me for 3 years to work with you and then Id put in arts council bids to support any production , cost to Lancaster etc.

Hi both
Had a chat with someone who arranges the applicant visitor days. 
They are interested but need to understand what could be done. Difficult for them to visualise. I guess we don't really know either at the moment. So is it possible that you could come up for a meeting? Yet to be arranged but in next few weeks, basically to sell the idea? Hope that's not too heavy but potentially if this works it could then spread across other departments in the university.  There would be a very small pot of money (£300) for a pilot if they are interested.

Thanks

This is great Rod, think it says it all really

Maybe making links like Maria has here to research locally in cloud 
security is a good idea. Maybe find examples of where research in 
microbiology has ended up with ideas in security design. Someone 
like Christine here would be good to input on that maybe and sure 
Maria can think of some examples. Funny how her presentation about 
the seems to be like a form of communication between contracts for 
services and autonomous security agents in the virtual machines; 
'feels' like biology somehow ;)

Like idea of keynote on cybersecurity in the evening and research jam and think a testimonial essential.

The data box people are part of the FACT game exhibition next year actually.

That said I don't think we necessarily need to 'justify' the experience in a different discipline in terms of utility or application; seem to recall that the feedback stressed how beneficial it was to be out of their field or comfort zone and just the experience of working with microbial life had a big impact thats easy to forget maybe.

We could make copy that sold that side of it a bit harder maybe but I think this is great! Sorry can't get up tomorrow but be nice to catch up maybe do a planning meet again down the line.

I was thinking attendance fee yes but no clue about how much.

Lab in afternoon of day 1 and am day 2.
Keynote in evening and research jam  in afternoon of day 2 would be fab.
Yes i think we could ask Adam about sponsoring/testimonial.

Subject: RE: corporate team building

Hello!
great idea - we could meet at 3pm eg LUMS café' space on Tuesday.

Before asking aruond we'd need a short abstract description of the 
event an estimate of costs (with high level breakdown) If it is for corporate team building, is there an attendance fee?
Is there enough material to cover two days?
I wonder if it could have a keynote presentation on cybersecurity in 
the evening / and research jam roundtable the day after before lunch 
time

As for people to sponsor, why not Blackberry itself? Could we have a testimonial from Alan?
Academic people I strat could speak with is PETRAS 
https://www.petrashub.org/petras-panel-at-cisco-security-conference/
there is a session on data privacy this Tuesday that I am hoping to 
attend with people from https://www.databoxproject.uk/

as for business links I'd go for KBC at infolab

finally, attached info for a forthcoming talk on cybersecurity at

INDIC: Security Monitoring as a Service in IaaS Clouds

Christine Morin
Univ Rennes, Inria, CNRS, IRISA

Increasingly organizations are shifting their computing infrastructure to the cloud. Although this might provide significant cost and efficiency gains, security remain a big concern.  The goal of the INDIC project is to enable the IaaS cloud operator to integrate security monitoring  terms in its SLAs (a form of Security as a Service). A client organization should be able to simply specify its needs in terms of security monitoring (vulnerabilities to monitor) and define, in its contract with the cloud operator, a tradeoff between the security monitoring  efficiency and its costs (e.g. degradation of functional performance,  allocation of shared resource parts). The cloud operator should therefore have a service that, from the SLAs of the client organization, automatically configures the security monitoring components are under its control, and automatically adapts them to the reconfigurations of the virtualized infrastructures.  I will focus on the design and implementation of a self-adaptable security monitoring framework that is able to react to dynamic events that occur in a cloud infrastructure and adapt its components in order to guarantee that an adequate level of security monitoring for tenant's virtual infrastructures is achieved without significantly impacting the trade-off between security and cost for both tenants and the provider.

We have designed, implemented, and evaluated a generic self-adaptable security monitoring framework and two instantiations with intrusion detection systems (SAIDS) and firewalls (AL-SAFE). SAIDS achieves the core framework's objectives while providing a scalable solution for serving parallel adaptation requests. AL-SAFE uses virtual machine introspection in order to create a secure application-level firewall that operates outside the monitored VM but retains inside-the-VM visibility. It follows a periodic introspection strategy and allows the tenant to specify the introspection period. We will present the experimental results showing SAIDS and AL-SAFE's ability to offer a balanced trade-off between security, performance and cost.

Subject: corporate team building

Hi Marie
You remember that idea for a lab workshop on microbial and (possibly other biological) communication systems? I met with Ross and Hwa Young today and we are thinking of organising one for a corporation (BT etc??) one of these as part of a package of events/activities (we didnt get the welcome grant on ClubBioMed by the way).  You might recall that Adam Boulton from Blackberry was very complimentary about the workshop he attended with us a couple of years ago.

It would probably be a 2 day residential workshop with them working in our teaching lab, outside term time so probably around easter.

It would fit with your cyber security theme and also environment and you all get to work with microbes!

Question is do you know of a company that might be willing to pay for this sort of thing? Or perhaps we could approach management school for leads.  Coffee after 2.30 tuesday? We can also talk about bow ties.
