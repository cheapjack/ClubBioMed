# ClubBioMed PhD
This README is a no-nonsense explanation of the core of a practice based PhD by artist Ross Dalziel

## Look at the convergence of research in bacterial communication and behaviour with digital and technical culture from the perspective of a participatory art practice.

### Convergence examples

 * Lab-on-a-chip developments
 * BioEngineering, Biological computation and Bioinformatics
 * Biological behaviour as models for technological engineering
 * DIYbio: Makers meet microbes 

### Perspective of the art practice

 * I don’t make spectacles of visual material or interactive art that offers materials for manipulation.
 * I do make messy participatory situations where people and knowledge can get entangled and foster forms of agency, literacy and ultimately resilience.
 * I make [Critical Kits](http://kits.re-dock.org/) and materials that support and embody these situations
 * I see the sciences and the technical not as subjects for artistic spectacle, speculation or critique but a technical culture for artists to critically participate in.
 * I want to widen the participation in technical and scientific literacy
 * I’m an embedded participant in maker and technical culture based at makerspace and co-working space DoESLiverpool
* I want to contribute to the development of combined arts and biological practice at Lancaster University

### What Do I Want To Find Out?

 * What are the opportunities for agency, literacy and resilience in this space? 
 * What are the opportunities to entangle scientific literacy with more diverse knowledge practices, practitioners and widen participation?
 * What Critical Kits can be made to embody and materialise these opportunities?
 * How do kits further embodied interaction?
 * How can kits contribute to the relation between STS research and artistic practice?
 * What is the nature of challenge in terms of literacy and agency in kit responses to bio-engineering?
 * What approaches informed by these questions can be made in the DIYBio space?
 * What are the scaling opportunities for Critical Kit and DIYbio practices along the lines of [RCA's Future Makespaces in Redistributed Manufacturing research](http://futuremakespaces.rca.ac.uk/) and MCQN ltd [IoT Maker scaling research](https://indie.mcqn.com/)

### How Am I Going To Do It

 * It's practice based, building on work developing kits and messy encounters with STEM, IoT, Maker and Network Culture with [FACT](http://fact.co.uk/), [Re-Dock](http://re-dock.org/), [Critical Kits](http://kits.re-dock.org/) and [Domestic Science](http://domesticscience.org.uk)
 * Make kits that embody and support artistic encounters in a range of social spaces and contexts from laboratory to local library, charity shop to indoor market, conference to country show, living room to allotment, makerspace to National trust property.
 * I will interact with a research group of biomedical researchers working on aspects of communication & chemotaxis/movement in biological systems using the  microbial and insect species already being studied at Lancaster. This informal group *ClubBioMed* co-founded with Dr Rod Dillon embeds maker culture and participative art practices with technology within the Biomedical & Life Sciences at Lancaster University.

 * Connect these groups with the wider arts, maker and tech community of the NorthWest
  * DoESLiverpool
  * Domestic Science
  * Network of libraries in the North West: Merseyside, Barrow and Morecambe 
  * FACTlab
  * OSHUG
  * UK Maker Belt Association
 
 * Stimulate crosstalk with novel research groups and informal clubs to widen the participation in technical and scientific literacy within the North West of the UK. 
 * Use this crosstalk to foster critical approaches to art and science collaborative practice.
