# ClubBioMed PhD
This README is a no-nonsense explanation of the core of a practice based PhD by artist Ross Dalziel

## Explore the ‘dark matter’ of the convergence of biological communication, taxis and behavior with technical culture from the perspective of a participatory artistic practice embedded in makerspace culture.

### This perspective considers the role of emerging maker, technical and artistic practices in building potentially transformative technology in this space. It considers the opportunities for agency, literacy and resilience through the frame of ‘Critical Kits’ that embody the convergence. 
### These kits are co-created with a research group, ClubBioMed, in the Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University, working on aspects of communication, chemotaxis and movement in biological systems using the microbial and insect species already being studied at Lancaster.   


#### Convergence examples

 * Lab-on-a-chip developments
 * BioEngineering, Biological computation and Bioinformatics
 * Biological behaviour as models for technological engineering
 * [DIYbio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do-it-yourself_biology): Makers and kits meet microbes: lab-on-a-chip-for-makers: where [DIY microfluidics](https://www.cytofluidix.com/low-tech-microfluidics/) meets [AIY](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/)

#### Perspective of the art practice

 * I rarely work in conventional art gallery settings or venues strategically situating work on the fringes of art festivals or heritage spaces in interim multi use pop up spaces; indoor and outdoor markets, canals, castles, docks, parks, bandstands, streets, churches, bath houses, factories, marinas, swan pedalos and industrial spaces. 
 * I don’t make spectacles of media or interactive art that offers materials for manipulation or reflection.
 * I do make messy participatory situations where people and knowledge can get entangled and foster forms of agency, literacy and ultimately resilience.
 * I make Critical Kits, technology and materials that support and embody these situations.
 * I see the sciences and the technical not as subjects for artistic spectacle, speculation or critique but a technical culture for artists to critically participate in.
 * I want to re-think public engagement with science as widening the diversity of participation in technical and scientific literacy
 * I’m an embedded participant in maker and technical culture based at makerspace and co-working space DoESLiverpool
* I want to contribute to the development of combined arts and biological practice at Lancaster University

#### What Do I Want To Find Out?

 * What are the opportunities for agency, literacy and resilience in this space? 
 * What are the opportunities to entangle scientific literacy with more diverse knowledge practices, practitioners and widen participation?
 * What Critical Kits can be made to embody and materialise these opportunities?
  * How do kits further embodied interaction?
  * How can kits contribute to the relation between STS research and artistic practice?
  * What is the nature of challenge in terms of literacy and agency in kit responses to bio-engineering?
 * What approaches informed by these questions can be made in the DIYBio space?
 * What are the scaling opportunities for Critical Kit and DIYbio practices along the lines of [RCA's Future Makespaces in Redistributed Manufacturing research](http://futuremakespaces.rca.ac.uk/) and MCQN ltd [IoT Maker scaling research](https://indie.mcqn.com/)

### How Am I Going To Do It

 * It's practice based, building on work developing kits and messy encounters with STEM, IoT, Maker and Network Culture with [FACT](http://fact.co.uk/), [Re-Dock](http://re-dock.org/), [Critical Kits](http://kits.re-dock.org/) and [Domestic Science](http://domesticscience.org.uk)
 * Make kits that embody and support artistic encounters in a range of social spaces and contexts from laboratory to local library, charity shop to indoor market, conference to country show, living room to allotment, makerspace to National trust property. 
  * Critically reflect on these encounters, feed into kit development and iterate
  * Use fine grained kit documentation as part of the writing up process. 
  * Kits embody the critical reflections, encounters and the written up research, ready for the field. 
 * I will interact with a research group of biomedical researchers working on aspects of communication & chemotaxis/movement in biological systems using the  microbial and insect species already being studied at Lancaster. This informal group *ClubBioMed* co-founded with Dr Rod Dillon embeds maker culture and participative art practices with technology within the Biomedical & Life Sciences at Lancaster University.

### Cross Talk

The practice based PhD proposals perspective, focus and methodology builds a foundation of cross talk across LICA, the Faculty of Health and Medicine, Division of Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster and local artistic and maker cultures.

### Wider Benefits

 * Widening participation and literacy in research through:
  * Embedding artistic and makerspace practices in the existing research and teaching of the biomedical life sciences at Lancaster, building on Rod Dillon’s pioneering work considering lab as artist studio.
  * Introducing ClubBioMed as a framework for widening participation in research and teaching culture at Lancaster
  * Building research partnerships between LICA and the Life Sciences 
  * Fostering inter-departmental cross-talk.
  * Contributing to undergraduate & post graduate art and science related teaching and resources 
  * Sharing expertise across faculty to articulate exciting opportunities for new students 
  * Further growing innovative cross-discipline groups for future contexts like the  Health Innovation campus
  * Making new mutually beneficial settings for the Critical Kits project and its partnerships to engage with and articulate research at Lancaster.
  * Co-designing, developing and deploying Critical kits to in teaching and research practice across departments at Lancaster University and public contexts in the North West. 
  * Critical kits to develop and deploy across public contexts in the North West raising profile and participation of research building new & existing connections through Ross Dalziel’s professional network
  * Maker events; Liverpool MakeFest, Liverpool Light Night, Mini Maker Faire Manchester
  * Liverpool Make Fest and other maker event networks e.g. Maker Assembly
  * Fesival of Maintenance 2018
 * Maker & artist led ecosystem:
