Consider a socially engaged art practice embedded in a critical  participation in technical culture. This practice is concerned with embodied knowledge not in an interactive sense where a set of materials are presented to be manipulated and explored without instruction, like VR, but through a series of strategic physical and discursive encounters that foster forms of grass roots agency. Distributed kits, social events, gamejams, clubs, symposia, labs, journeys and github repositories.

Use key practices from the *dark matter* of technical culture, the upstream source of 'digital making' and the so-called 'maker-movement', part of a media archeology that includes medialab culture, as a method to work with a research group, we can reveal key opportunities for agency through the methods of an art practice in these settings.

## Key Methods

 * Critical Kit making
 * Community documentation and version tracking
 * Maintenance as resilience

This technical culture is the background of 'makerspaces' and part of a longer timeline of the 'media lab' developments well mapped out by [Hannah Stewart at NESTA](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/top-findings-open-dataset-uk-makerspaces), with some historical perspectives at  [whatisamedialab](http://whatisamedialab.com/overview/) and [here](https://wiki.hackerspaces.org/)

What is often behind the trestle table, the *dark matter* is a form of distributed *resilience* that is not so much about *disruption* and *making* the world anew but about community maintenance, documentation, agency and optimisation as a form of resilience.  

However importing some of the more essential dark matter into more traditional science labs; microbiology labs were few humanities tread has revealed essential methodologies and models for an art pratice that focusses on embodied knowledge and engages with emerging science and technology. 

An embodiement distributed across a plethora of kits, actions, situations and perspectives rather than an embodiement of a media artwork

Study what emerges from embedding these media-lab/hackerspace hybrids around some hybrid research in a traditional microbiology lab and teaching facility in the faculty of life sceinces at Lancaster University.
