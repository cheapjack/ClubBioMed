## ClubBioMed

ClubBioMed is a framework for supporting creative, collaborative, cross-discipline work around the Biomedical and Life Sciences at Lancaster University co-founded by Dr Rod Dillon and artist Ross Dalziel.

Clubs are just like real clubs: mobile low cost engaging interest groups around a shared interest. They can get big stay small pop up out of nowhere or vanish again, they might have a twitter account facebook page meetup account, website or blog or its a regular lunch or pint in and around the campus organised by A4 paper stuck on a notice board at the Co-op. 

They can be made up and led by students, departmental researchers and teachers, visiting and residential artists or senior management. 

ClubBioMed keeps track of them, supports them and reminds each one of each other then points it to the outside world in an accessible way. It makes sure the clubs get embedded in departmental research and teaching **culture**. It's like the watery films that let bacterial life move and 'communicate' around the fungal hyphae of slower flows of formal research, informal learning encounters and teaching.
